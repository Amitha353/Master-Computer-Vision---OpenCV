# Master-Computer-Vision---OpenCV
OpenCV - 12 Computer Vision Mini-Projects - Udemy

## Computer Vision is a cutting edge field of computer science that aims to enable computers to understand what is being seen in an image.
* Machine can see and understand the world around them.

### Computer Vision can be challenging
1. Camera sensor and lens limitation.
2. Viewpoint variations.
3. Changing Lighting. (Non-uniform brightness);
4. Scaling. (unequal sizes)
5. Non-rigid deformations. (Motion of the horse - not rigid; Motion of physical objects in the world is, in general, nonrigid. With every step, the motion of the object changes. )
6. Occlusion. (Effect of one object in a 3-D space blocking another object from view.)
7. Clutter - Background with too many patterns, information, image - making it difficumt to extract the required data.
8. Object class variation. (Class bed -> could have various forms -> sofa, chait to a queen-size bed);
9. Ambiguous images / Optical illusions -> Vase / 2 faces;
