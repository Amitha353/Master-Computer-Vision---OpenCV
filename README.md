# Master-Computer-Vision---OpenCV
OpenCV - 12 Computer Vision Mini-Projects - Udemy

## Computer Vision is a cutting edge field of computer science that aims to enable computers to understand what is being seen in an image.
* Machine can see and understand the world around them.

### Computer Vision can be challenging
* Camera sensor and lens limitation.
* Viewpoint variations.
* Changing Lighting. (Non-uniform brightness);
* Scaling. (unequal sizes)
* Non-rigid deformations. (Motion of the horse - not rigid; Motion of physical objects in the world is, in general, nonrigid. With every step, the motion of the object changes. )
