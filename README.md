# Master-Computer-Vision---OpenCV
OpenCV - 12 Computer Vision Mini-Projects - Udemy

## Computer Vision is a cutting edge field of computer science that aims to enable computers to understand what is being seen in an image.
* Machine can see and understand the world around them.

### Computer Vision can be challenging
1. Camera sensor and lens limitation.
2. Viewpoint variations.
3. Changing Lighting. (Non-uniform brightness);
4. Scaling. (unequal sizes)
5. Non-rigid deformations. (Motion of the horse - not rigid; Motion of physical objects in the world is, in general, nonrigid. With every step, the motion of the object changes. )
6. Occlusion. (Effect of one object in a 3-D space blocking another object from view.)
7. Clutter - Background with too many patterns, information, image - making it difficumt to extract the required data.
8. Object class variation. (Class bed -> could have various forms -> sofa, chait to a queen-size bed);
9. Ambiguous images / Optical illusions -> Vase / 2 faces;

### OpenCV in Python
1. Python is one the easiest languages to learn.
2. Powerful for data science and machine learning applications.
3. Stores images in numpy arrays which allows to perform powerful operations easily.

## Mini-Projects
1. Making a Live Drawing Sketch of yourself.
2. Shape Matching.
3. Counting circle and ellipses.
4. Finding Waldo.
5. Object Identification.
6. Face, Pedestrian and Card detection.
7. Live Face Swaps.
8. Face Reader.
9. Handwritten Digit Recognition.
10. Facial Recognition.
11. Ball Tracking.
12. Photo Restoration.
